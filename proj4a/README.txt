my_beaglebone.jpg is a picture of me holding my BeagleBone.

connected.jpg is a picture of my remote command prompt session. You can see the name of the BeagleBone is 004786402, my student ID, and the ifconfig output is also displayed, namely the info under wlan0.

copy.png is a picture of my local command prompt terminal session, and the successful pscp copy of my file hello_world.c file to the remote server. I tested this command out with another file, schedule.png, and you can see the test in that picture too. Once I ran the pscp command, my BeagleBone's password credentials were requested.

build_run.png shows me building and running hello_world.c.

git.png shows me cloning my repository (git was already installed on my BeagleBone, so there wasn't anything to show for installing it).
