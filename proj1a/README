Contents:
C source file - lab1a.c 

This file can be compiled into a executable that can accept an argument (--shell). This essentially tells the program to run the input in another process, which is executing as a bash shell. Without the argument, the executable simply puts the terminal into non-canonical mode with no echo and processes/outputs the input from the keyboard.

Makefile

This file has three modes: make (default), make dist, make clean. The first option simply compiles and builds the executable lab1a. The second option gathers all the necessary files for submission into a tarball. The third option erases all files that were created by the option 'make'. 

README

This file; documents the author of the code and the contents of the submitted tarball.
